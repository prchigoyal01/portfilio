Hi! I'm a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in Federated Learning (FL) and Large Language Models (LLMs), driven by their potential to solve real-world challenges. At Microsoft, I design scalable and reliable APIs for Teams Graph, honing my expertise in large-scale systems and optimization. My research journey began at IIIT Delhi, where I co-authored a novel FL algorithm published at ICASSP 2024, advancing privacy-preserving decentralized learning. Outside of tech, I find joy in fitness, painting, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I also advocate for diversity in STEM, mentor aspiring women in tech, and share my love for AI/ML through workshops and leadership initiatives. With a strong foundation in research and engineering, I aim to create impactful, transformative solutions.
